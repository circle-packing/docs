# Planning

End of September & October 2015

* Start.
* Getting to know the Circle Packing Problem (CPP).
* Literature study CPP.

November 2015

* Literature study CPP heuristics.
* Exploring constructive/greedy heuristic (best-fit algorithm).

December 2015

* Start implementation of first version of best-fit.

January 2016

* Exams, break period from thesis.

February 2016

* Presentation showing the proposed best-fit heuristic for circle packing.
* Finishing up first version of the best-fit algorithm (with simplified bounding-sphere).
* Literature study for 'smallest enclosing circle of circles' (bounding-sphere) algorithms.
* Start implementing second version, with bounding-sphere support.

March 2016

* Continue implementation of second version.
* Create automated tests for comparing the algorithm to known results, as well as results for much higher circle count than other heuristics allow.

April 2016

* Finish implementation of second version.
* Refine and add more automated tests to use as results in the thesis.

May 2016

* Initial version of my thesis.
* Exploring possible improvement steps for the best-fit algorithm, try implementing some if time permits this.

June 2016

* Final version of the best-fit implementation.
* Final version of my thesis.
